                <h5>Highlights from the past season:</h5>
                <p>What an incredible season we have had. We celebrated our 50th year 
                    of running trips down the Grand Canyon. This year we ran 36 trips 
                    down the Grand Canyon introducing over 800 people to one of our 
                    favorite places on earth. We trained 4 new guides and welcomed 
                    them to our family. The season started off with some chilly weather 
                    in the early season, but our guests braved the cold and loved every 
                    minute of their trip (show pictures). Later the temperatures soared 
                    reaching highs of 120 F in the Grand canyon and 95 on the Salmon. 
                    We didn't have any trouble getting people in the water at those 
                    temperatures.

                <h5>Encounters in the wild!</h5>
                <p>Our trips are all run in some of the most remote areas of the United 
                    States. We share these areas with lots of critters both large and 
                    small. Here are some tips on what to do if you should find yourself 
                    face to face with one.

                    Scorpions: There are hundreds of varieties of scorpions, most of them 
                    being harmless. There are, however, a handful of them that can be 
                    dangerous and even potentially lethal. Scorpions can be found in almost 
                    every ecosystem and are very adaptable to their environment. The 
                    scorpion that calls Phantom Ranch in the Grand Canyon home is the 
                    Bark Scorpion, the most venomous in the United States. Do not worry 
                    though, the bark scorpions are only lethal to their prey and luckily 
                    humans are not on that list! 
                    
                    They spend the day hiding and crawl out at night to hunt. They will 
                    eat crickets, moths, spiders and other insects. Many compare their 
                    sting to an intense bee sting. Relief can be found with ice, aspirin 
                    and time.
                    
                    When in the canyon, pay attention to where you are walking at night. 
                    Always wear your shoes or sandals. Always have a light with you to see 
                    where you are going. Never try to capture a scorpion and if you get 
                    stung, see your guide immediately.
                    
                    Big horn sheep: For many people, bighorn sheep symbolize the rugged 
                    mountain west. It is one of two species of wild sheep in North America. 
                    It is compact body is muscular with chocolate brown fur. Most weigh 
                    160-250 lbs. They have exceptional vision, hearing and smell that 
                    helps them detect and avoid predators.
                    
                    Their large curved horns can weigh up to 30 lbs. Females also have 
                    horns but they are short with a slight curvature. Horns are used as 
                    tools for eating and fighting.
                    
                    If you encounter a big horn sheep, do not agitate it. The park service 
                    asks that you stay 100 feet away from big game animals. Leave them 
                    enough room for escape if they feel threatened.
